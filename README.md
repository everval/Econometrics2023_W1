# Econometrics_W1
Exercises for Econometrics course

We will use Github classroom to hand-in the assignments and your solutions.

Start by opening the Ex_Week1.pdf file.

The file *capm.pdf* contains the CAPM exercise you will replicate. 

The file *capm_starter_code_pluto.jl* and *capm_starter_code_pluto.pdf* contain a simple example for the solution using Pluto, while the *capm_starter_code_julia.jl* contains the same example using Julia without Pluto.

Create the necessary codes on this project and push your final solutions.
